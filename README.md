# 🚗 CryptoRide

CryptoRide is a Starknet-powered decentralized transportation platform revolutionizing the ride-sharing industry. By connecting riders and drivers directly through blockchain technology, we eliminate costly middlemen while providing unprecedented security, transparency, and flexibility. Our platform offers tamper-proof smart contract escrow payments, real-time ride verification, and gives drivers the freedom to choose between cryptocurrency or traditional fiat payouts. With CryptoRide, every journey is not just a ride—it's a step toward a more equitable, efficient, and accessible transportation ecosystem for everyone.
